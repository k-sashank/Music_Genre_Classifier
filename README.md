# Music_Genre_Classifier
This is a simple Music Genre Classifier made using Tensirflow and Keras.
The music files were first converted into Audio Spectograph Images and these images were fed to a CNN Classifier.
As a whole pipeline, the flow is 1. Converting the audio file(s) to it's Spectogram image and 2. Feeding this Image to the trained CNN to find its genre.
The dataset used to make this classifier can be found here:
